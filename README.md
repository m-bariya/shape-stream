# shape-stream
Algorithms for streaming clustering of time series events. 

These algorithms identify and update k time series event clusters. The clusters are updated as new events are added to the dataset in a streaming fashion. The underlying clustering approach builds on kshape, which uses normalized cross correlations as a distance metric.
